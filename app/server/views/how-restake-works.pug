    h2 How KYVE RESTAKE works
    p KYVE RESTAKE makes use of a feature in Cosmos blockchains called Authz. This allows a validator (or any other wallet) to send certain pre-authorized transactions on your behalf.
    p When you enable KYVE RESTAKE you authorize the validator to send Delegate messages for their own validator address. We cannot #[strong spent your funds] only delegate. Authorisation expires automatically after your selected date and you can revoke at any time
    p #[strong Kyve restake works only for protocol nodes]
